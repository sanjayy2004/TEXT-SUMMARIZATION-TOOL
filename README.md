üìù Article Summarization Tool
This project is a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that automatically generates concise summaries from lengthy articles. It uses a powerful transformer-based model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) from Hugging Face's transformers library to understand and summarize large text inputs effectively.

üöÄ Features
Summarize long articles into short, readable paragraphs.

Choose between manual text input or uploading a .txt file.

Built with transformers and PyTorch.

Easily extendable for web or GUI applications.

üìå How It Works
The user is prompted to either paste the article manually or load it from a text file.

The script processes the input using a pre-trained BART model fine-tuned for summarization tasks.

The summary is displayed directly in the terminal.

üõ† Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Hugging Face Transformers (facebook/bart-large-cnn)
